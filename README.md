# Housing-Price-Prediction
This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median
housing price for each block group in California. Block groups are the
smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample
data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We
will call them “districts” for short.
The model learns from this data and predicts the median
housing price in any district, given all the other metrics
